        <p>Some argue that cloned individuals will lose their autonomy and individuality because they share the same genes with others. As a result, clones might face social discrimination and be seen as duplicates.</p>
        <p>However, as Plomin (2016) demonstrates, personality and behavior are not solely determined by genetics but are also influenced by environmental factors. Like twins, clones would have unique identities shaped by their experiences. Somerville (2000) suggests that education and legal frameworks can reduce societal biases and ensure clones are seen as individuals with full autonomy.</p>
