        <h2>The Future of Human Cloning</h2>
        <img src="images/future.png" alt="Future potential of human cloning" style="width:50%;margin:20px auto;display:block;">
        <p>Technological advancements like therapeutic cloning could lead to breakthroughs in organ regeneration, genetic research, and treatments for previously untreatable conditions. As BMC Medical Ethics (2024) notes, CRISPR technology, once controversial, has already been used to treat genetic diseases such as sickle cell anemia, paving the way for similar success with cloning technologies.</p>
        <p>These advancements could address major challenges, such as organ rejection, and save countless lives.</p>
