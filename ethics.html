            Critics argue that cloning raises ethical concerns about individuality and autonomy. Cloned individuals might face discrimination and be seen as duplicates rather than unique people. Furthermore, opponents believe that cloning technology violates the natural rules of reproduction, creating life artificially rather than through traditional means.

            However, as Plomin (2016) pointed out, genetics only partially determine identity, while environmental factors play a significant role. Like twins, clones can develop their own unique experiences and personalities, making them fully independent individuals. Additionally, Somerville (2000) suggested that societal biases could be mitigated through education and legal protections, ensuring that clones are treated as equal members of society.
