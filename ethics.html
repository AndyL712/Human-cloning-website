        <p>Some argue that cloned individuals will lose their autonomy and individuality. They may face societal discrimination and be seen as duplicates. However, Plomin (2016) demonstrates that personality and psychological development depend not just on genes but also on environmental factors. Like twins, clones can develop unique identities through their life experiences.</p>
        <p>Somerville (2000) suggests that societal biases against clones can be mitigated through education and legal protections, ensuring that they are accepted as individuals with full autonomy.</p>
